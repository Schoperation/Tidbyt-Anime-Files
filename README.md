# Tidbyt Anime Files

These files are used by the [Crunchyroll Anime Checker Tidbyt app](https://github.com/Schoperation/Crunchyroll-Anime-Checker) to retrieve the latest episodes and pictures for (almost) all anime on the [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) website.
I needed a public place for the app to get it, so here it is.

There are posters and episode thumbnails stored in an encoded format in these files for easy rendering on the Tidbyt. I do not own them whatsoever. They are owned by their respective owners and are only here for convenience of the Tidbyt app. They can be seen by following their respective URLs back to Crunchyroll.
